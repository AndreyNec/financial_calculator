# financial_calculator 

This is my first attempt to create basic financial calculator on Python. 

This code enables you to calculate:
1) N - number of periods;
2) I/Y - yield;
3) PMT - coupon or payment in a period;
4) PV - present value;
5) FV - future value;

I also intend to improve on the initial version of the code a I progress further with Python. 
My next step is to add the NPV calulaiton to the list. 
I also intend to bring a web brower version later on. 
Code is basic and is good to understand for a Python beginner with some background in finance. 

I will be glad to get a feedback on how I could imporove the code.
